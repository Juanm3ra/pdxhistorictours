            <dd>Two related websites:
            http://oregontourco.com/
            https://www.seatosummit.net/
            They are related because they are both touring websites for Portland, Oregon.
            The dropdown menus are nice. The colors of the first website are great, they go with the state of Oregon. Probably add a couple of videos on the clients website; everyone likes videos, what better way to advertise.</dd>
